# AI Features Showcase
## Project Overview
It's clear that going forward, every software engineer will be expected to know how to work with AI models, just like other core competencies we're expected to know like working with databases. 

To kickstart my AI engineering learning journey, I took the "Build AI-Powered Apps" course from www.codewithmosh.com and built this AI Features Showcase project. I dedicated over 40 hours to learn these concepts and put them into practice by developing this full stack, AI powered web application from the ground up - no vibe coding involved whatsover. Some of the concepts covered in this course:

- Fundamentals of large language models (LLMs)
- Prompt engineering
- Modern full stack architecture (Bun, Express, React, MySQL, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- Implementing real, useful AI features into web applications
- Working with both commercial AND open source AI models
- Coding best practices
